Tried to make the title bar functional after I styled it correctly but eventually ended up with breaking the app. Just reverted to the previous version and decided that for the moment it is not a priority and I will move on with developing the functionality of the app.\\n\\nFound out a library that should allow you to create a custom title bar. However it seems that the problem is the fact that DOM elements when using react should be preloaded or eventually some stuff must be preloaded. I will investigate and try to check if eventually there is a connection. Because the problem I had was that eventually the event listener wasn't recognizing the elements of the DOM so I'm assuming that this has to do with how the DOM elements are rendered.\\n\\nThe problem I had with the solution I implemented was the fact that IPC didn't seem to communicate well and eventually the buttonification of the button elements was just not working. I don't understand the problem fully since all the code was setup exactly how the normal listener and ipc would work WITHOUT react.\\n\\nI think that in general react is creating much more problems than anything else. Eventually let's check if all this will still be the case with the actual functionalities. Next time I'll try to implement at least the basic UI with the left side that has the name of the clients and the initial menu with the choice of creating a new training plan or a new periodization.\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
