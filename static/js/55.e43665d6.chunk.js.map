Strange that things like Django where not mentioned. \\n\\nProbably will use CMS to handle backend logic and eventually wanna implement tailwind to simplify and streamline CSS and styling. Eventually it will all boil down to functionalities implementation. The roadmap for the application once everything is setup must eventually be drawn. Once the roadmap is drawn I will decide what to implement, in which stages and ultimately to just have things working step by step.\\n\\n1. Implemented the general UI subdivision in 2 areas. Left side for the clients management, right side for the functionalities of the app.\\n\\t1. Still need to implement a dragbar to resize the two areas relative to each other for visibility.\\n\\nFound out about Express.js as a MIT licensed method to implement backend into an Electron App. I'm still quite thinking that possibly React is complicating my front end development, but this will become more evident the more I develop.\\n\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
