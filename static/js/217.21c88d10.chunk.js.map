It is using the express.js framework. At the moment Javascript still look super foreign to me, but eventually this is my first touch with this language, it will look much much more familiar the more I pour hours into it. The idea is that of setting up a communicating backend and frontend. Eventually the backend will work with the Electron wrapper once I'm in production environment and I have deployed the app with the exe. Don't care at the moment.\\n\\nFirst of all I'm trying to define API endpoints that will handle some get requests. For the moment a simple log console message or string will be enough just to see if I can ask stuff to the backend, get it in return, and do shit with it.\\n\\nStarting to define routes in react, because at the end of the day this is a single page application, so It should dynamically handle the UI interaction of the users.\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
