Eventually to handle the backend logic I will need a backend framework (Django for example was a backend framework, just like Express.js). On the other side CMS are more than just backend services.\\n\\nI'll be trying to make use of Express.js and see if it fits my purpose. Another important thing that I should do is try to design the workflow of my app. This is a good exercise as I've seen from top level developers that eventually need to start to work on a project.\\n\\nI'll try some ground level work with the Express.js and then see if I can use React Router to make the app single page (this is the idea I had from the beginning).\";"],"names":[],"sourceRoot":""}
