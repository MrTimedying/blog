This is an interesting and important milestone in my journey as it sets the foundation for a skill that is very useful eventually also for future project. Being able to quickstart a project, which I'm already working on the UX/UI, is something that will serve me well in the future giving that I will probably want to develop other small apps that can serve me in different ways.\n   \n   For the start I have to admit that it was way easier than setting up a project with Tauri. It might be for the fact that a Tauri project requires some rust knowledge or is it just a different framework than Electron. Eventually, for the moment being, that particular framework is not as developed as Electron and cannot be approached with 0 rust knowledge especially for the backend. The lure that the cheaper costs in term of resources that the final app would've had are mitigated by the simplicity of development that eventually I will meet.\n   \n   Still I'm expecting a challenge. This time it was in the form of the toolbar. I went with a `frameless` approach setting the `frame: false` in the parameters of the Window that is being generated by the render process of Electron.\n   \n   After that I had the first taste of what React components are and eventually I had to create my first component that will act as a customized window bar on a frameless window."}}]);
